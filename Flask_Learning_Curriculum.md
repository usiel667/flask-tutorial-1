### üîç Areas for Improvement
Based on your current implementation, here are the next logical steps:

1. **Data Management**: Currently no database or data persistence
2. **User Input**: No forms or user interaction beyond navigation
3. **Dynamic Content**: Static content only
4. **Error Handling**: No custom error pages or validation
5. **Security**: No authentication or security measures
6. **Testing**: No automated testing
7. **Deployment**: Local development only
